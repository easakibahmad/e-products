        <ol starts="1">
            <li>When researcher Bob Thomas constructed the computer software Creeper, which could move through the ARPANET network, cybersecurity testing started. The programme Reaper was developed by Ray Tomlinson, who created email, and it chased and removed Creepers.</li>
         </ol>
         <h2>Advantage of cybersecurity</h2>

        <img src="cs.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="400">
        <p>Any data transferred by your computer and other devices to the network is protected by hardware and software in this method. Network security protects the IT system and prevents cybercriminals from stealing, manipulating, or spying on people.</p>
